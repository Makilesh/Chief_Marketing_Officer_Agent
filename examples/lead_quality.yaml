# Example: Lead Quality Issue
# Usage: python main.py --config examples/lead_quality.yaml

problem: |
  Our lead volume is up 30% but sales conversion rate dropped from 15% to 8%.
  Sales team reports that leads are "tire kickers" and not decision makers.
  Need to improve lead quality without sacrificing volume too much.
